<p>First post! Excited to spin up this website and get going on more work. Hopefully it&#39;ll be a productive project for me to stretch my brain. Anyway, some thoughts on the times. Shit sucks. Lots of people are really cut up about everything. So am I, to be honest. </p>
<h2 id="screen-beans">Screen Beans</h2>
<p>I&#39;m thinking about Cathy Belleville&#39;s Screen Beans. Clipart we&#39;ve seen all over the internet for our entire lives. On slides, websites, menus, everything. She was paid $10,000 by Microsoft once. ONCE! For images that hundreds of millions of people have seen. It&#39;s hard to imagine, but this kind of exploitation is so normal. Some company comes along and takes what they want. So what&#39;s the point? Screen Beans still made an impact, I&#39;ve learned Belleville&#39;s story, now have you. Read more about it! Any piece, any foothold we can take against the hegemony is important. Realize that companies don&#39;t care about anything but cash. Take care of each other, relish in Screen Beans. Relish in togetherness and shit.</p>
